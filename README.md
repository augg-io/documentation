# Getting Started with augg.io

1. First create an empty project using [00 - Create an empty project](00_create_an_empty_project.md) or download our example project and follow [Setting up Example project](01_setting_up_auggio_in_a_project.md)  
2. After having a ready to go project we need to setup augg.io plugin in the project. Follow [01 - Setting up augg.io in a project](01_setting_up_auggio_in_a_project.md)  
3. During the process of setting up augg.io you will need to create a Google Service Account and ARCore API Key. When needed follow [02 - Creating Google Service Account and getting Google API Key](02_creating_google_service_account_and_getting_google_api_key.md)  
4. Now is a great time to start using our scanning app [The Scanning Application](The_Scanning_Application.md) and create your experiences.  
5. After that you can start using augg.io. [03 - Start using augg.io](03_start_using_auggio.md)
