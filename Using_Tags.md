# **Using Tags**

# **Tags in augg.io CMS**

Tags allow you to create customizable labels that can be assigned to objects. 
You can also link tags with collections, which automatically links them to objects theyâ€™re assigned to.  
This guide will walk you through creating, using and managing tags.

### **Why use Tags**

Tags can help you organize and categorize objects in meaningful ways.

**Example:**  
Suppose you are creating an Easter egg hunt game. Players find eggs of different colors, and each color has a different point value. 
After placing the eggs, you can create tags that match the egg colors and assign them to the eggs. 
When the game is over, you can quickly and easily identify which objects (eggs) belonged to which color group thanks to the tags.
