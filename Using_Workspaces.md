# **Using Workspaces**

# **Workspaces in augg.io CMS**

Workspaces let you organize applications, locations, and experiences into separate environments.  
This is especially useful when you have many applications, locations, experiences and also multiple people in organization.  
This guide will walk you through creating and managing workspaces.

### **Why use Workspaces**

Workspaces are especially useful for keeping your content organized when you have many applications, locations, and experiences.  
You can think of them like folders that group related items together.

Workspaces are also helpful when multiple people in the same organization are working on different projects, since each project can be kept separate in its own workspace.

## **Creating a Workspace**

To create a new workspace:

1. Click on your current workspace or navigate to **Workspaces** on the left side menu
2. Click the **New Workspace** button

3. Enter a name and, optionally, a description for your workspace

You can manage your workspaces from the **Workspaces** tab

### **Switching Workspace**

To switch to another workspace:

1. Click on your current workspace in the top-right menu
2. Select the workspace you want to switch to
