# How to Update augg.io SDK

## Update Process

### 1. Remove the Old SDK

- Navigate to your project's Assets folder
- Delete the existing augg.io SDK folder (in example project located at `Assets/augg.io`)

### 2. Insert the New SDK

- Copy the new SDK files into your project
- Place them in the same location (in example project under `Assets/augg.io`)

- In Unity, go to **Window â†’ Package Manager**
- Find and select the augg.io plugin in the package list
